How would you describe command line?<br>
Command line is the code that sits behind everything you use on your computer, acting as the interface between what you input into applications (e.g. use your mouse to click on a file to open it) and communicating this to the computer.

Examples of command lines and what they do:<br>
  pwd (print working directory) - shows you where in the file structure you are currently working.
  ls (list directory) - lists all files and folders sitting withing the current directory you are working in.
  cd (change directory) - used to move between directories (folders).
  mkdir (make directory) - creates a new directory.
  rmdir (remove directory) - removes a directory.
  cp (copy) - copies a file or directory.
  mv (move) - moves a file or directory.
  touch - creates a file.
  dir -r (find files) - used to search for specific files.
  git init - used to initialise a code repository on your local drive (pc/laptop), used for tracking changes and controlling versions of the code as it's being worked on (especially useful when multiple people are working on the same thing).
